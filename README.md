# stylelint-plugin-carbon-tokens

This project is intended to help users identify cases where tokens, functions
and mixins defined as part of various projects relating to the Carbon Design
System are used. [www.carbondesignsystem.com]

It consists of a stylelint plugin and depends on various Carbon Design System
packages for loading settings.

It includes, but may not be limited to, linting for @carbon/themes,
@carbon/colors, @carbon/layout, @carbon/type and @carbon/motion.

Not included, as they're not used through SCSS, are Carbon Icons, Grid and any
other DOM related checks..

NOTE: The parameters of Carbon functions are not normally tested as these do no
typically have Carbon tokens as parameters.

## Please be helpful

Before we start this project is a work in progress which deliberately outputs
warnings when it comes across a syntax that has not yet been catered for. If you
see one of these warnings please raise an issue so that it can be addressed.

## Stylelint

Before you can use this stylelint plugin you will need to install and configure
stylelint.

See https://www.npmjs.com/package/stylelint for details

NOTE: Just in case you were wondering, yes you can use comments to enable and
disable the linter. E.g. // stylelint-disable-next-line

## Installation

```bash
npm install stylelint-plugin-carbon-tokens
```

```bash
yarn add stylelint-plugin-carbon-tokens
```

## BREAKING CHANGES from version 2

- Moves to ECMAScript modules following stylelint 16. This will impact anybody
  using CJS or a build expecting CJS files.
- `carbon/layout-token-use` has been renamed to `carbon/layout-use`.
- `carbon/theme-token-use` has been renamed to `carbon/theme-use`.
- `carbon/type-token-use` has been renamed to `carbon/type-use`.

### Version 2 documentation

- [README.md](../main-v2/README.md)
- [Layout token use](../main-v2/src/rules/layout-token-use/README.md)
- [Motion duration use](../main-v2/src/rules/motion-duration-use/README.md)
- [Motion easing use](../main-v2/src/rules/motion-easing-use/README.md)
- [Theme token use](../main-v2/src/rules/theme-token-use/README.md)
- [Type token use](../main-v2/src/rules/typ-token-use/README.md)

## BREAKING CHANGES from version 1

- `carbon/motion-token-use` has been renamed to `carbon/motion-duration-use`.
  This was to allow `carbon/motion-easing-use` to be added.
- `acceptUndefinedVariables` now defaults to false. As a result undefined
  variables will either need to be passed as `acceptValues` or be disabled.

## Usage

Add it to your stylelint config `plugins` array.

```js
module.exports = {
  // stylelint.js
  // ...
  plugins: ['stylelint-plugin-carbon-tokens'],
  //...
};
```

Then add rules as follows:

```js
modules.exports = {
  // stylelint.js
  //...
  rules: {
    //... other rules
    'carbon/layout-use': true,
    'carbon/motion-duration-use': [true, { severity: 'warning' }],
    'carbon/motion-easing-use': true,
    'carbon/theme-use': true,
    'carbon/type-use': true,
    //...other rules
  },
  //...
};
```

NOTE: Motion is shown above with a standard stylelint secondary option
`severity` set to `warning` the default is `error`.

FYI: There are few automated fixes with --fix. See
[Automated fixes](#Automated-fixes)

FYI: With regards to math. See [What math is OK?](#What-math-is-OK)

### Fix

Version 2 introduces the ability to auto fix some usage. See the rule README
files for details.

#### NOTES

1. Automatic fixes should be reviewed in the same way any other code is
   reviewed.
2. Fixes may be tagged `/* fix: see notes */` in this case there may have been
   multiple options or other criteria making the replacement unclear. The first
   match identified will be used.
3. Currently does not support partially fixing a line e.g. `margin: 2px 3px 4px`
   will not become `margin: $spacing-01 3px $spacing-02` as 3px.

## Recommended config

- [Strict](./config/strict.js)
- [Recommended](./config/recommended.js)
- [Light touch](./config/light-touch.js)

You can copy and paste the rules in these files, which is great for
customization. However, the simplest way to make use of these rules is to add as
follows to your stylelint config.

```js
  extends: ["stylelint-plugin-carbon-tokens/config/recommended"]
```

### Other Stylelint switches

It's good practice to document any linter disables and to tidy up any that are
no longer needed. As a result it is recommended that you use the following
switches as part of your stylelint command.

- --report-descriptionless-disables
  [https://stylelint.io/user-guide/usage/options#reportdescriptionlessdisables]
- --report-needless-disables
  [https://stylelint.io/user-guide/usage/options#reportneedlessdisables]

### Carbon Versions supported

Carbon V10 and V11 are supported. If in the same repository (e.g. mono repo)
each package will require it's own stylelint config and pass a `carbonPath` to
each rule and optionally a `carbonModulePostfix`;

## Variables

SCSS `$variables` and CSS `--variable` declared before are checked.

## Secondary Options

Each of the rules listed above have secondary options which are documented in
the individual rule README.md files along with defaults..

- [Layout use](./src/rules/layout-use/README.md)
- [Motion duration use](./src/rules/motion-duration-use/README.md)
- [Motion easing use](./src/rules/motion-easing-use/README.md)
- [Theme use](./src/rules/theme-use/README.md)
- [Type use](./src/rules/type-use/README.md)

The simplest type of secondary options are boolean and of the form
`acceptSomeThing: Boolean`

e.g.

```js
modules.exports = {
  // stylelint.js
  //...
  rules: {
    //... other rules
    'carbon/theme-use': [
      true,
      {
        severity: 'warning',
        acceptCarbonColorTokens: true,
      },
    ],
    //...other rules
  },
  //...
};
```

## Advanced options

These options when omitted to accept the defaults. They are intended to support
non-standard use cases and accept values that use a syntax which may well need
some refining as the project moves forward.

- includeProps: Array
- acceptValues: Array
- acceptScopes: Array
- enforceScopes: Boolean

Arrays of strings and/or Regex followed by a range in angled brackets.

The defaults for these are defined in the individual README files listed above.

- `includeProps: []` - Indicates default, same as omitting the property
- `includeProps: ["*"]` - Indicates default, same as omitting the property
- `includeProps: ["/^\\$my-color--/", "*"]` - SCSS variable starting
  "\$my-color--", plus default values specified

The acceptValues option allows you to check your own tokens refer to values
acceptable to the linter.

- `acceptValues: ["$/^\\$my-color--/"]` - Accept SCSS variables starting
  "\$my-color--"

The acceptScopes option allows you to alter the scope value for all rules using
regex or a string. For example you may wish to use short scope names.

- `acceptScopes: ["**"]` - accept all scopes
<!-- cspell: disable-next-line -->
- `acceptScopes: ["/^la(yout)?$/", "/^mo(tion)?$/", "/^th(eme)?$/", "/^ty(pe)?$/"]` -
  using regex to accept abbreviations
- `acceptScopes: ["la", "mo", "th", "ty"]` - abbreviations but not defaults
- `acceptScopes: ["la", "mo", "th", "ty", "*"]` - abbreviations plus defaults
  with "\*"

By default scopes are not expected, but that means

- `enforceScopes: true` - An accepted `scope` or `*` is enforced for carbon
  tokens.

### Excluding included props and accepted values

There may be occasions where your defined config or defaults do not match your
requirements.

Entries in `includeProps` and `acceptValues` can be removed by explicitly naming
and prefixing them in your config.

For example using either of the following results in `line-height` not being in
the list of props checked.

- `includeProps: ["!line-height"]`
- `includeProps: ["$/^\\$my-height--/", "*", "!line-height"]`

### includeProps Range

Can include a range value expressed inside greater than and less than signs.

e.g. `["/prop-a$/<-1>", "/prop-b$/<1 -2>"]`

The above specifies the last value of `prop-a` and the first to second last of
`prop-b`,

It can be applied either to regex or string values and allows values or a range
of values to be selected from a multipart value.

The range value allows values to be selected from a multipart value such as a
box-shadow.

- Positive values represent positions at the start of a value list e.g. 1 is the
  first value.
- Negative values represent positions at the end of a value list. e.g. -1 = last
  value

- If no range is specified the whole value list is checked.
- A single value means only that value in a list is checked
- Two values represent start and end values of a range in the list.

### includeProps specific values

For some props e.g. transform we are only interested in values that match a
certain criteria.

This is specified as part of the includedProp inside [].

e.g. `translate[/^transform/]`

In this case only values starting `transform` are tested so not `skew` for
example. As per the prop definition the can be a plain string or regular
expression.

### Function values specific range for function parameters

If not specified then parameters are treated as a single value.

The range for parameters is specified in ()

e.g. `calc(1)` or `translate(1,2)`.

NOTE: this is not currently a user configurable option.

## Automated fixes

Automated fixes are limited to those where a 1:1 mapping exists between a value
and a carbon token. These values can be either be Carbon tokens from older
versions or hard coded values. E.g. `16px` to `$spacing-05`.

The main reason there are few automated fixes is that it is very hard to
translate from physical value or scss variable or css custom property or
function to a logical version. It is also the case that the user may not have
imported the relevant SCSS file, or even have the package installed. Although
the relevant Carbon packages are currently listed as dependencies they may be
more loosely coupled in the future and a user would still need to import them in
order to build.

### Color

Gray 80 - #393939 is the value used by the following color tokens:

- (White and Gray 10 theme) - $interactive-02 and $inverse-02
- (Gray 90 theme) - $ui-01, $field-01, $active-secondary and $disabled-01
- (Gray 100 theme) - $ui-02, $ui-03, $field-02, $active-secondary, $selected-ui
  and $skeleton-02

Now having a setting for the theme in the options would narrow this down to at
best two and even there it is hard to pick one.

### Layout

The task is perhaps simpler for layout where Carbon only lists spacing tokens
(2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 32, 40, 48)px and layout tokens (16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96,
160)px, however, the full picture includes container tokens (24, 32, 40, 48,
64)px, icon-size (16, 20)px, fluid-layout tokens (0, 2, 5, 10)vw.

### Motion

Motion is a combination of timing and easing and is a possibility as there is a
one to one match between timings and tokens. The easing functions are slightly
more complicated with some undocumented values declared with the timing values,
that said Carbon lists six distinct options here
https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/motion/overview

### Type

Is not just one css value but a range of values; type, font-size, line-height,
font-weight and letter-spacing. There are also functions which could be used to
font-weight and font-family. In theory, we should only see font-weight
explicitly set by function or mixin, line-height however can be used as a layout
mechanism in some scenarios.

## What math is OK?

The range of math permitted is limited in order to ensure carbon tokens are used
appropriately.

| Math                              | Description                                               |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `calc(P O $)`                     | Where P is (%, vw or vh), O is (+ or -) and \$ is a token |
| `calc(-1 * $)` and `calc($ * -1)` | To allow negation                                         |

### Not allowed

While it is tempting to allow arbitrary math on tokens, such as the following.

e.g. `$layout-01 * 1.25` or `$layout-01 - 2px`

Doing so would allow any value to be constructed without the user having to add
any reasoning in the source file. The recommendation here is to use a stylelint
disable and add a comment.

```scss
// stylelint-disable-next-line carbon/layout-use
top: calc($layout-07 * 3.14); // A value related to PI was needed
```

While this example is a bit silly it serves to demonstrate how easy allowing
arbitrary math would allow any value, not using the mini-grid could be
calculated.

If there is demand, an option to allow the loosening of this rule could be
created (feel free to submit a PR). This would likely go no further than
allowing multiplication by whole numbers so as to keep the result on a mini-unit
boundary.
